# Flow Control- Worksheet and Practice 
    # Some control statements affect or control the execution of other statements in some way.

# ifelse() function 
  # ifelse() function in R, this function has the form -> ifelse (testexpression, yes, no)
    # "testexpression" is the logical condition, "yes" is what ifelse() will return if the logical testexpression is truem and "no is what ifelse() returns when false 
  # Example 1: Convert a character vector to a numeric vector (ifelse function)
x <- c("female", "male", "male", "female", "female", "male", "female")
x
class(x) #tells you if it's numeric or character 
y <- ifelse(x=="female", 0, 1) # the 0 basically means female while 1 means male 
y    
class(y) # now it's numerica but basically says the same stuff 
  

  # Example 2: Convert unifrom random numbers to binomail random numbers 
# runif(n, parameters of distribution) create random numbers from some specific probability distrubition 
x <-runif(10,0,10) # create random numbers form a uniform distribiton from 0 to 10 
x
ifelse(x > 5,1,0) #returns 1 for values greater than 5, and 0 for the others 

  #Try this: import gss_cat dataset, create a new variable racenew only with values 0 and 1, 1 presents white, 0 represents non-white

# for loop 
  # Control how many times statements are repeated 
  # If we want to run the same block of code multiple times. The for() statement allows one to specify that a certain operation should be repeated a fixed number of times. 
    # iterate n times over an index

  # Example 1: Print the squared values of 1 ~ 10
n <- 10

  print(i^2)

}
# also can do...
x <- 1:10

  print(i^2)

    # a MAJOR issue is that we can only PRINT it. notice [1] in each line of output.
    # Instead, assign the loop output into a NEW vector called "squared_values"
squared_values <- rep(0,10) # create an empty numeric vector with 10 elements

#iterate over all items in a vector
